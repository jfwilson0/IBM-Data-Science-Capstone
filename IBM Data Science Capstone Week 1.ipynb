Then, we will create a dataframe with following parameters: id, name, categorie ,latitude coordinate, longitude cordinate, distance to the hotel address. Once we have created that dataframe, we will proceed to filter the restaurants to select only the ones that are specialized in Vegan food and that have ratings above 7.0. Then, we will sort the dataframe in ascending order to find the closest restaurant from our initial location."

With this function, we will create a numpy array (Matrix) with all the distances between each of the restaurants.
